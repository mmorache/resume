# About Me

Hi there! I'm Mathias Morache. This repository is home to my [resume](https://mmorache.github.io/resume/), but let me share a few highlights about myself. I’ve got over twelve years of experience in tech, split between software development and my early roots in networking and systems. My main specialties include Python, AWS, and all things data. I hold a masters degree in Data Science, as well as undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and English. Currently, I'm working on an MBA with a concentration in Analytics.

When I’m not immersed in code, you can find me climbing mountains, recoding my pop-punk album, or hanging out with my [four cats](https://mmorache.github.io/vet_analysis/) (yes, four!). Feel free to explore and connect with me if you'd like to chat about tech, data, or cats.
