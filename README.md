# About Me

Hi there! I'm Mathias Morache. This repository is home to my [resume](https://mmorache.github.io/resume/), but let me share a few highlights about myself. I’ve got twelve years of experience in tech, split between software development and my early roots in networking and systems. My main specialties include Python, AWS, and all things data. I’m also wrapping up a graduate degree in Data Science, set to finish coursework by February and officially graduate in May 2025.

When I’m not immersed in code, you can find me scaling mountains, making music, or hanging out with my [four cats](https://mmorache.github.io/vet_analysis/) (yes, four!). Feel free to explore and connect with me if you'd like to chat about tech, data, or cats.
